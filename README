To run the chess bot, first make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system (check with python --versionor python3 --version). Next, install the required package by typing pip3 install python-chess in your terminal. 
When the program starts, it will print a banner with the time and ask whether the bot should play as White or Black; type w if you want the bot to move first, or b if you want to move first. You will then be asked to either press Enter to start from the normal chess setup or enter a custom FEN string to load a specific position. Once the game begins, type your moves in UCI format (for example e2e4 for pawn to e4, g1f3 for knight to f3, or e7e8q for pawn promotion to queen). If your move is illegal or mistyped, the program will reject it and ask again. After each of your moves, the bot will respond automatically, always preferring captures if they are available, otherwise choosing a random legal move. The game continues until an official chess end condition is reached, such as checkmate, stalemate, insufficient material, the 75-move rule, or fivefold repetition, and the program will print a message explaining the result.
